## Elections Process
The election process is limited to BACON subgroup members. Subgroup members that are nominated will be given time to share about their interest followed by an election. Elected persons then become chair-elect for 1 year followed by chair for 2 years, and culminating in 1 year to provide guidance and mentorship as a past chair. This is a 4 year commitment and we welcome those with both senior-level expertise as well as junior-level members with energy and dedication.
