# About the PALISI BACON Subgroup

The BACON subgroup is focused on clinical, translational and basic research on the viral lower respiratory tract infections commonly called bronchiolitis by clinicians. We aim to improve short- and long-term outcomes via database research, observational epidemiology studies, basic science, and interventional trials. New members and junior investigators are always welcome and there are ample opportunities for mentorship and collaboration.

BACON is a PALISI subgroup focused on clinical, translational and basic research involving viral lower respiratory tract infections commonly called bronchiolitis by clinicians. We aim to improve short- and long-term outcomes via database research, observational epidemiology studies, basic science, and interventional trials. New members and junior investigators are always welcome and there are ample opportunities for mentorship and collaboration. We are open to discussing new ideas for future research proposals and welcome guest speakers to share about ongoing research projects.

BACON is a member network in the International Severe Acute Respiratory and emerging Infections Consortium (ISARIC), a leading global research group studying severe respiratory, epidemic, and emerging infections around the world. (click here)

BACON has also collaborated with RSV GOLD, an international group investigating RSV mortality (click here).

## Current Leadership

## History
BACON began as a collection of researchers interested in understanding more about bronchiolitis. Initial research efforts aimed to gain a deeper understanding of the prevalence and impact of bacterial co-detection in intubated patients with bronchiolitis. Due to pandemic-related changes in social distancing and viral infections, BACON shifted its focus and resources to creating a multinational prospective study investigating the epidemiology around COVID-19 in the pediatric ICU setting. With involvement from around the world, BACON continued its ability to move quickly and answer questions with large volumes of patients through its newest research project, BACON 2.0. Multiple subgroup analyses are currently ongoing and we welcome interested persons to reach out through one of our many means of contact.
